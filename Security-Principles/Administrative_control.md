Administrative controls (also known as managerial controls) are directives, guidelines or advisories aimed at the people within the organization. They provide frameworks, constraints and standards for human behavior, and should cover the entire scope of the organizationâ€™s activities and its interactions with external parties and stakeholders.

It is vitally important to realize that administrative controls can and should be powerful, effective tools for achieving information security. Even the simplest security awareness policies can be an effective control, if you can help the organization fully implement them through systematic training and practice.

Many organizations are improving their overall security posture by integrating their administrative controls into the task-level activities and operational decision processes that their workforce uses throughout the day. This can be done by providing them as in-context ready reference and advisory resources, or by linking them directly into training activities. These and other techniques bring the policies to a more neutral level and away from the decision-making of only the senior executives. It also makes them immediate, useful and operational on a daily and per-task basis.
