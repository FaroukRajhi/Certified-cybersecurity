Physical controls address process-based security needs using physical hardware devices, such as badge readers, architectural features of buildings and facilities, and specific security actions to be taken by people. They typically provide ways of controlling, directing or preventing the movement of people and equipment throughout a specific physical location, such as an office suite, factory or other facility. Physical controls also provide protection and control over entry onto the land surrounding the buildings, parking lots or other areas that are within the organization’s control. In most situations, physical controls are supported by technical controls as a means of incorporating them into an overall security system.

Visitors and guests accessing a workplace, for example, must often enter the facility through a designated entrance and exit, where they can be identified, their visit’s purpose assessed, and then allowed or denied entry. Employees would enter, perhaps through other entrances, using company-issued badges or other tokens to assert their identity and gain access. These require technical controls to integrate the badge or token readers, the door release mechanisms and the identity management and access control systems into a more seamless security system.
