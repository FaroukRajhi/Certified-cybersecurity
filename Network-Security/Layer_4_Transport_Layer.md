# Hardware

- Routers and Firewalls

# Addresses

- One device can use many different ports and be associated with different services

# Traffic are segments

* TCP
- Connection oriented and reliable
- Negotiation and handshake and forms a transport layer session
- Traffic passing backwards and forwards is numbered with a sequence number allowing identification of missing segments.

* UDP
- Connection less and unreliable.
- Does not negotiate or perform a handshake
- Send something quickly, but you can't identify missing segments.

# Protocols

- Telnet
- FTP
- HTTP
- SSH
- FTPS/SFTP
