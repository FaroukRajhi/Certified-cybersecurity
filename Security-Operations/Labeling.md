# Data Handling Practices - Labeling

Security labels are part of implementing controls to protect classified information. 
It is reasonable to want a simple way of assigning a level of sensitivity to a data asset, such that the higher the level, the greater the presumed harm to the organization, and thus the greater security protection the data asset requires. 
This spectrum of needs is useful, but it should not be taken to mean that clear and precise boundaries exist between the use of “low sensitivity” and “moderate sensitivity” labeling, for example. 

# Data Sensitivity Levels and Labels 

Unless otherwise mandated, organizations are free to create classification systems that best meet their own needs. In professional practice, it is typically best if the organization has enough classifications to distinguish between sets of assets with differing sensitivity/value, but not so many classifications that the distinction between them is confusing to individuals. Typically, two or three classifications are manageable, and more than four tend to be difficult. 

* Highly restricted: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could possibly put the organization’s future existence at risk. Compromise could lead to substantial loss of life, injury or property damage, and the litigation and claims that would follow.

* Moderately restricted: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could lead to loss of temporary competitive advantage, loss of revenue or disruption of planned investments or activities.

* Low sensitivity (sometimes called “internal use only”): Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could cause minor disruptions, delays or impacts.

* Unrestricted public data: As this data is already published, no harm can come from further dissemination or disclosure.
