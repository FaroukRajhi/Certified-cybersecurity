# Data Handling Practices - Destruction

Data that might be left on media after deleting is known as remanence and may be a significant security concern. Steps must be taken to reduce the risk that data remanence could compromise sensitive information to an acceptable level. This can be done by one of several means:  

* Clearing the device or system, which usually involves writing multiple patterns of random values throughout all storage media (such as main memory, registers and fixed disks). This is sometimes called “overwriting” or “zeroizing” the system, although writing zeros has the risk that a missed block or storage extent may still contain recoverable, sensitive information after the process is completed.

* Purging the device or system, which eliminates (or greatly reduces) the chance that residual physical effects from the writing of the original data values may still be recovered, even after the system is cleared. Some magnetic disk storage technologies, for example, can still have residual “ghosts” of data on their surfaces even after being overwritten multiple times. Magnetic media, for example, can often be altered sufficiently to meet security requirements; in more stringent cases, degaussing may not be sufficient. 

* Physical destruction of the device or system is the ultimate remedy to data remanence. Magnetic or optical disks and some flash drive technologies may require being mechanically shredded, chopped or broken up, etched in acid or burned; their remains may be buried in protected landfills, in some cases.

In many routine operational environments, security considerations may accept that clearing a system is sufficient. But when systems elements are to be removed and replaced, either as part of maintenance upgrades or for disposal, purging or destruction may be required to protect sensitive information from being compromised by an attacker.
