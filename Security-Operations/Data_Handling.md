Information is an asset that needs to be categorized to understand its value.
Value and risk associated with the asset drives protection. Need to know what we have.
Risk-based approach to security:
  - Risk
  - Likelihood
  - Vulnerability

Information has its own lifecycle:
  - Create
  - Store
  - Use
  - Share
  - Archive
  - Destroy
Understand how to treat information and each phase of its life cycle.

# Classification

A way to reflect the value of an asset is to create a series of groups or classification.
Levels or types of information:
  - Driven by what the organization needs, perceived risk and type of asset.
  - Usually 3 to 4 levels - higher security environments require more.
Descriptive to guide people in allocating the assets into the proper category.
Works well when used consistently and accurately.
Performed by the owner of the information asset.
Need to know - grant access based on classification.

# Retention

Should be a systematic process:
  - Retention policies
  - Retention procedures
What must vs should we retain?
  - Duration
  - Format
  - Protection
Who decides?
  - Arbitrary (some)
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Understanding obligations
What can't we keep?
  - Arbitrary (some)
  - Privacy
  - Regulatory compliance
