A representation of a file:
  - Unique.
  - Fixed length.
  - Seemingly random.
  - Nonreversible.

We can think of this as a "fingerprint" of the input.
Different inputs will have different hash values.
Uses of hashing.

Common hash algorithms include:
  - Message Digest 5 (MD5) 128-bit digest.
  - Secure hashing algorithm (SHA) 160-512 bit digest.
