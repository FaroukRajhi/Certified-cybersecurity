Three areas:
  - Symmetric.
  - Encryption.
  - Hashing.

Use cases:
  - Confidentiality - nobody can read the file except the intended recipient.
  - Integrity - managing the integrity of the file using something like hashing.
  - Availability - increasing availability of the file once encrypted.
  - Privacy - readable by only those that should have access (authorized)

Encryption has a long history - to find ways to protect those communications.

Alphabet-based systems:
  - Early systems
  - Swapping one letter or digit for another.

Number-based systems:
  - Computer and information age.
  - Individual characters are represented by a numeric value.
  - Mathematical computations are performed on that numeric value.
  - Represent a letter as a digit and using a computer perform mathematical calculation as part of the encryption algorithm
