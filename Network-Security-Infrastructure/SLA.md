The cloud computing service-level agreement (cloud SLA) is an agreement between a cloud service provider and a cloud service customer based on a taxonomy of cloud computing– specific terms to set the quality of the cloud services delivered. It characterizes quality of the cloud services delivered in terms of a set of measurable properties specific to cloud computing (business and technical) and a given set of cloud computing roles (cloud service customer, cloud service provider, and related sub-roles).

Think of a rule book and legal contract—that combination is what you have in a service-level agreement (SLA). Let us not underestimate or downplay the importance of this document/ agreement. In it, the minimum level of service, availability, security, controls, processes, communications, support and many other crucial business elements are stated and agreed to by both parties.  

The purpose of an SLA is to document specific parameters, minimum service levels and remedies for any failure to meet the specified requirements. It should also affirm data ownership and specify data return and destruction details. Other important SLA points to consider include the following:

Cloud system infrastructure details and security standards

Customer right to audit legal and regulatory compliance by the CSP

Rights and costs associated with continuing and discontinuing service use

Service availability

Service performance

Data security and privacy

Disaster recovery processes

Data location

Data access

Data portability

Problem identification and resolution expectations

Change management processes

Dispute mediation processes
